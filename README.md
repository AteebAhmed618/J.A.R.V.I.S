J.A.R.V.I.S. - A Python Voice Assistant
J.A.R.V.I.S. is a personal voice assistant built in Python. This project demonstrates how to integrate various Python libraries to create a conversational, multi-functional application that can interact with you using both voice commands and a conversational AI backend.

‚ú® Features
Voice Interaction: Uses a masculine, robotic voice and listens for a wake word.

Dynamic Commands: Recognizes and executes commands to perform tasks like searching, browsing, and playing music.

Conversational AI: Integrates with the Google Gemini API to handle general questions and engage in natural conversation.

System Utilities: Reports on CPU usage and battery status.

Email Management: Sends emails via voice commands (requires a Gmail App Password).

Music Player: Plays, pauses, resumes, and stops a local music file (music.mp3).

To-Do List: Manages a simple to-do list stored in a file (todo.txt).

Interruptible Speech: A "stop talking" command allows you to interrupt J.A.R.V.I.S. mid-sentence.

‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
To run this assistant, you need to have Python 3.6 or higher installed. You also need to install the following libraries. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:

pip install playsound SpeechRecognition gTTS pyttsx3 psutil pygame google-generativeai

You may also need to install PyAudio for microphone support:

pip install pyaudio

üöÄ Getting Started
1. Configuration
Before running the program, you must update the jarvis.py file with your specific configuration details. Open the file and modify the following variables in the --- CONFIGURATION --- section:

EMAIL_ADDRESS: Your Gmail address.

EMAIL_PASSWORD: An App Password for your Gmail account. You can generate one from your Google Account security settings.

GEMINI_API_KEY: Your API key from Google AI Studio.

MIC_DEVICE_INDEX: The index of your microphone. You can find this by running a simple Python script provided in the main file's comments.

2. Required Files
music.mp3: Place an MP3 file named music.mp3 in the same directory as the jarvis.py script for the music commands to work.

todo.txt: The program will automatically create this file when you add your first to-do item.

3. Running the Assistant
Once you have configured the file and installed the prerequisites, you can run the program from your terminal:

python jarvis.py
